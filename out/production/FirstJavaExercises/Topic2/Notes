In the program I tried to code the user class and all the printer classes completely
decoupled with the use of the interface Printers. Also, I used the factory design pattern for
the instantiation of the printers objects.
If we introduce a new printer we only have to add it in the PrintersFactory and slightly modify
the code in the main class (for inform the user the introduction of a new printer), in this way
we don't have to modify the class user, the main code and the interface Printers.
